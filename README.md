# ABSTRACT

This Tic-Tac-Toe program demonstrates the application of the minimax algorithm to create an optimal computer opponent. Key features include robust game logic for managing the board, handling user input, and determining outcomes such as wins, draws, and invalid moves. By leveraging recursion in the minimax algorithm, the program evaluates all possible game states to ensure the computer always selects the best possible move, offering a challenging and fair gameplay experience. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, it provides clear instructions and feedback, making it both an engaging game and a practical introduction to game AI concepts like decision-making and adversarial search algorithms.
